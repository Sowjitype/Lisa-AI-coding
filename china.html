  <h3 class="header">List of 5 Famous Places in China</h3>
  <p class="world">
    <strong>Fobidden City</strong><br>

Top among the places to visit in Beijing - it is the heart of Beijing - the lifeline of the local folks who have been inhabiting the destination for centuries. This was during the reign of Hongwu Emperor and his son, Zhu Di. When Zhu Di ascended to take the throne over, he moved the Chinese capital from Nanjing to Beijing and thus, the construction of the Forbidden City began.<br><br>
    <strong>Potala Palace</strong><br>
    2.The palace is one of China’s most magnificent structures that was constructed as a fortress and a residence for the Dalai Lama but was initially a place for political and religious treasures. This palace is divided as: The Red Palace - this was built to safeguard the important shrines and murals that depicted scenes from the life of the Dalai Lamas and the Tibet kings. The White palace -this impressive structure includes sleeping quarters, reception rooms etc that remained untouched since 1959<br>

This army was accidentally found in the year 1970 while some farmers were digging wells and then it was traced back to when it was first built around 280 BC.<br>
